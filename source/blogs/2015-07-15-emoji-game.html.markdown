# Emoji Game Station.

This is where you can easily find The Melbourne Emoji Game which was originally posted on my Twitter Page [@TheSpacepony](https://twitter.com/thespacepony){:target="_blank"}.

I dropped out of University to pursue a career in tech. I was studying a [Bachelor of Information Technology majoring in Games and Graphics Programming at RMIT](http://www2.rmit.edu.au/Courses/pdf/bp215.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

I made this game after being inspired by a similar riddle for the London Tube, which was widely credited for driving the internet to distraction. I ended up driving Melbourne to that [same distraction](http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/how-well-do-you-know-melbournes-train-stations-take-this-emoji-quiz-20150714-gic1p0.html){:target="_blank"}.
