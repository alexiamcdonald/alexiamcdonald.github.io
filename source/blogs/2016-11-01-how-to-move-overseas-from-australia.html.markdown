# How to move overseas from Australia

## Get rid of everything

When moving overseas it's best to get rid of as much as you possibly can. Really love that awesome bicycle you own? Sorry, it has to go. If there are small things you want to keep you can always post them to your new address overseas but if you can do without it then get rid of it.

Ways to rid yourself of crap:

- Sell it on Gumtree or through Facebook
- Give it away to friends
- If it's useless meaningless crap throw it out
- Donate to charity (they sometimes even come pick it up for you!)

If you plan on selling your crap remember to give yourself a few weeks to do it. A lot of people who buy things off the internet are useless at turning up or even following through with their purchases.

## Disconnecting utilities

### Water/Gas/Electricity
Very simple to do. Just call them up a few days before you leave to disconnect the services.

#### Internet
This one was actually a kicker for me. I ended up having to pay extra because I forgot to read the fine print for cancellation. Some internet companies *cough* TPG *cough* want you to cancel at least 30 days before. If you are leaving before 30 days you might have to pay a cancellation fee unless you find some kind soul to take over your services.

[This person's website was very helpful when cancelling my TPG account](http://www.wes.id.au/2014/02/cancel-tpg-adsl/)

#### Mobile services
If you know you are going to leave sometime in the future make sure you call your mobile provider every couple of months to complain about the shitty service of your postpaid contract account. If you do this it will provide a very easy way for you to cancel the contract without incurring expensive costs that are usually associated with contracts.

When it's time to leave just explain that you wish to cancel your contract due to extremely awful service and you'll usually have your service either heavily discounted or waived completely.

## Finances
It's a good idea to pay your finances ahead of time. Exchange rates are terrible and you don't want to be that person who's traveller cheques aren't accepted. No one does cheques anymore coz they are super lame!

You have some alternatives.

- Get yourself a credit card with "No foreign transaction fees on online or overseas purchases"
I had a look around the [Bankwest Zero Platinum Mastercard](http://www.bankwest.com.au/personal/credit-cards/compare-credit-cards/zero-mastercard-no-annual-fee-credit-cards) was the best one I could find for my situation and it also offered complimentary travel insurance. Make sure you look up a credit card compare site to find the best deal for your scenario.

- Set up a money transfer account

[XE Money Transfer](http://www.xe.com/xemoneytransfer/au/?WT.seg_1=XTR-400x30-XHOM-ADH-AU-V01-161031) is a great way to easily transfer money between your Australian account and your new overseas bank account. It's a little bit of a hassle to setup and they might randomly call you in the middle of the night from some foreign country to confirm you're a legit person.

There is also [Transfer Wise](https://transferwise.com/) as well. It's a much nicer web experience and verification takes less time too! You can easily set it up with Facebook or your Google account. Either way I'll end up using one of the two to transfer money to myself.

- Tell your banks you are going overseas

- Set up paperless statements if you haven't already done this

## Setup appointment time

As soon as you have found out if your visa has been approved your next step should be to set up an appointment date to have your fingerprints and photo to be taken.

## Packing your suitcase

As I was travelling to other countries on the way to Sweden. I needed to make sure that my suitcase was going to be compliant with all the airlines weight limits. I had a goal of making my suitcase 20kg even though with my first flight I was allowed 32kg. I looked up the weight limits for all the different airlines that I was flying with. Some ranged from 32kg to 20kg and I decided that it was probably best to aim for 20kg.

I donated a lot of clothes to charities so that I could reach my weight limit and with some things I really wanted to keep but didn't need straight away I chucked into a box for shipping at a later date. I still haven't the box sent but I plan on sending it through Pack and Send as they seemed the cheapest when I looked up shipping under 30kg.

I had the unfortunate scenario of travelling to different countries with different weather. I was really hoping that I would be able to pull of the 'no winter clothes' but it fucking started snowing in Sweden before I left Australia so I had to prepare. I had to pack sandals, winter shoes and my normal shoes. I had to pack a jacket for winter and of course my jacket in Australia is really shit because I'm from Australia and they don't know how to do anything correctly.
