#### How to find a Job in Tech.

#### Too many websites.

It‚Äôs weird how I hear from people I went to University with or
people I run into who have a tech degree and they can‚Äôt find a job. That flatmate
is correct. We need a lot of devs to take care of the internet. We
don‚Äôt have enough developers at the moment to take care of all those websites
and we are going to need a lot more if the population keeps growing and every
man, woman, child and their doge üêï wants a website.

#### But there are no jobs.

It‚Äôs a fallacy that there are no jobs in tech. I‚Äôm going
to give it to you really, really blunt. The reason you can‚Äôt get a job in tech is
because you‚Äôre not trying. Looking on seek.com.au or whirlpool is not where you
are going to find a job. Sure, there are jobs on there but they are not the jobs
I suspect you want.

#### Are you passionate?

Passion is what you need. Clearly, if you had passion you
would have a job by now. Are you working on something now? Are you keeping
yourself busy with what you love? Seriously, people who are passionate about
what they love get jobs. They get emails all the time from people asking to hire
them. If you aren‚Äôt getting emails from people asking you to work for them then
something is wrong.

#### Practice what you don't know.

Oh, congratulations you just got out of University
and you know absolutely nothing. Trust me, you know nothing! If you haven‚Äôt been
pursuing your passion outside of University, then I‚Äôm telling you now you are at
square one. University only teaches you the basics. It teaches you stuff that is
10 years old that you aren‚Äôt ever going to use (maybe some of it). I bet you
they did not teach you about writing tests for your code and if they did well you
got lucky. Practice code outside of university and learn new things.

#### Be part of the community.

The easiest and best way to get a job is through
someone you know already. If you don‚Äôt know anyone who works in tech then you
aren‚Äôt any closer to your goal of getting a job. You need to be part of the
community and be noticed. Plus, this is a really good way to learn what is new
and trendy at the moment and a great way to find a mentor who can help you when
things get tough. Being part of the community gives you a way to find new
projects to work on, meet people in tech, help others and be passionate about
the things you love!

#### How?

You can get started by working on a project on [Github](https://github.com/) or
attending Hackathons. You can also work on that awesome personal project you
have been thinking about for ages but haven't actually done yet!

To be part of the community you can attend meetups, follow slack channels for
programming communities, IRC or forums. Reading and watching videos on the
latest tech innovations is also a really good way to increase your knowledge.

If there isn't anything you feel you can be part of you can always start your
own either at university or through other avenues.

Good luck!
