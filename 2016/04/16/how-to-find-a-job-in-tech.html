            <p>You're still working on that website that you were working on 4 weeks ago?
          That‚Äôs a lot of work for one website. There must be a lot of
          programmers because if you think about how many websites there are, that‚Äôs a lot.
          - Flatmate</p>
          </blockquote>
          
          <h4 id="too-many-websites">Too many websites.</h4>
          
          <p>It‚Äôs weird how I hear from people I went to University with or
          people I run into who have a tech degree and they can‚Äôt find a job. That flatmate
          is correct. We need a lot of devs to take care of the internet. We
          don‚Äôt have enough developers at the moment to take care of all those websites
          and we are going to need a lot more if the population keeps growing and every
          man, woman, child and their doge üêï wants a website.</p>
          
          <h4 id="but-there-are-no-jobs">But there are no jobs.</h4>
          
          <p>It‚Äôs a fallacy that there are no jobs in tech. I‚Äôm going
          to give it to you really, really blunt. The reason you can‚Äôt get a job in tech is
          because you‚Äôre not trying. Looking on seek.com.au or whirlpool is not where you
          are going to find a job. Sure, there are jobs on there but they are not the jobs
          I suspect you want.</p>
          
          <h4 id="are-you-passionate">Are you passionate?</h4>
          
          <p>Passion is what you need. Clearly, if you had passion you
          would have a job by now. Are you working on something now? Are you keeping
          yourself busy with what you love? Seriously, people who are passionate about
          what they love get jobs. They get emails all the time from people asking to hire
          them. If you aren‚Äôt getting emails from people asking you to work for them then
          something is wrong.</p>
          
          <h4 id="practice-what-you-dont-know">Practice what you don't know.</h4>
          
          <p>Oh, congratulations you just got out of University
          and you know absolutely nothing. Trust me, you know nothing! If you haven‚Äôt been
          pursuing your passion outside of University, then I‚Äôm telling you now you are at
          square one. University only teaches you the basics. It teaches you stuff that is
          10 years old that you aren‚Äôt ever going to use (maybe some of it). I bet you
          they did not teach you about writing tests for your code and if they did well you
          got lucky. Practice code outside of university and learn new things.</p>
          
          <p><img src="http://i.giphy.com/ypO01RIuQ3tHW.gif" alt="&quot;Nothing is impossible&quot;" /></p>
          
          <h4 id="be-part-of-the-community">Be part of the community.</h4>
          
          <p>The easiest and best way to get a job is through
          someone you know already. If you don‚Äôt know anyone who works in tech then you
          aren‚Äôt any closer to your goal of getting a job. You need to be part of the
          community and be noticed. Plus, this is a really good way to learn what is new
          and trendy at the moment and a great way to find a mentor who can help you when
          things get tough. Being part of the community gives you a way to find new
          projects to work on, meet people in tech, help others and be passionate about
          the things you love!</p>
          
          <h4 id="how">How?</h4>
          
          <p>You can get started by working on a project on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> or
          attending Hackathons. You can also work on that awesome personal project you
          have been thinking about for ages but haven't actually done yet!</p>
          
          <p>To be part of the community you can attend meetups, follow slack channels for
          programming communities, IRC or forums. Reading and watching videos on the
          latest tech innovations is also a really good way to increase your knowledge.</p>
          
          <p>If there isn't anything you feel you can be part of you can always start your
          own either at university or through other avenues.</p>
          
          <p>Good luck!</p>
